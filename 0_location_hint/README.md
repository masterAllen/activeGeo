This directory is used to build our Location Hint Dictionary.

**Note: For convenience, we refer to 'country/region' as 'country'! (Because 'country or region' makes names too long, such as `dict_city_by_country_or_region`.) This project has nothing to do with politics. If you feel offended by any part of this project, please do not hesitate to contact us!**


This directory will output some files located in `pickle_bin`, we have given these results.
