Build Location Hint Dictionary.

### Note
**For convenience, we refer to 'country/region' as 'country'! (Because 'country or region' makes names too long, such as `dict_city_by_country_or_region`.) This project has nothing to do with politics. If you feel offended by any part of this project, please do not hesitate to contact us!**
