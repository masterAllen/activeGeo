You should put `dict_server_info.bin`, `dict_client_info.bin`, `dict_serverclient_rtt.bin`, `dict_clientserver_rtt.bin` to the directory `picke_bin`, which is involved in the directory `3_make_ping`.

Requirement: put some files in `pickle_bin`:
- `dict_countrycode_info.bin` in `0_location_hint`
- `dict_server_info.bin` in `3_make_ping`
- `dict_client_info.bin` in `3_make_ping`
- `dict_serverclient_rtt.bin` in `3_make_ping`
- `dict_clientserver_rtt.bin` in `3_make_ping`

We have put the above files in the directory as a demo, and due to the file size, only 10,000 endpoints are used.
