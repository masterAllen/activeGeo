Geolocation :)

Requirement: put these files in `pickle_bin`:
- `dict_countrycode_info.bin` from `0_location_hint`
- `dict_server_info.bin` from `3_make_ping`
- `dict_client_info.bin` from `3_make_ping`
- `dict_serverclient_rtt.bin` from `3_make_ping`
- `dict_clientserver_rtt.bin` from `3_make_ping`

We have put the above files in the directory as a demo, and due to the file size, only 10,000 endpoints are used. If you want data, please send us email to explain your purpose.
